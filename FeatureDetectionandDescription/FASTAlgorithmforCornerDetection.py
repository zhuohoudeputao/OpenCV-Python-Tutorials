# let the intensity of pixel p be Ip 
# the pixel p is a corner if there exists a set of n contiguous pixels in the circle (of 16 pixels) which are all brighter than Ip+t, or all darker than Ipâˆ’t
# A high-speed test was proposed to exclude a large number of non-corners
# ## Machine Learning a Corner Detector
# store the 16 pixels around the feature point as a vector
# ![avatar](https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/fast_eqns.jpg)
# devide vector into 3 subsets based on three states
# Define Kp to true if p is a corner and false otherwise
# Use the ID3 algorithm (decision tree classifier) to query each subset using the variable Kp for the knowledge about the true class
# ## Non-maximal Suppression
# Detecting multiple interest points in adjacent locations
# Compute a score function, V for all the detected feature points
# V is the sum of absolute difference between p and 16 surrounding pixels values
# Consider two adjacent keypoints and compute their V values
# Discard the one with lower V value
# ## Summary
# Fast but not robust, it's depend on threshold
